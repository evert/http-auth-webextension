HTTP Auth Web Extension
=======================

This Web Extension is designed to make HTTP authentication more user-friendly.

Currently it shows that you are logged in to a website using HTTP Basic Auth, 
and allows you to log out easily.

Without this extension, it's only possible to log out by restarting your
browser.
